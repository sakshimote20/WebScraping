ðŸš€ Project Alert: Web Scraping with Infinite Scroll & Image Data Extraction! ðŸš€

This project is related to the web scraping, where I scraped data from Stockmages. ðŸ’»

Key features:

 1)Auto-scroll functionality: Implemented infinite scrolling to scrape image data from the entire webpage effortlessly.<br>
                                                                                                                       
 2)Data extraction: Scraped image details, including img_link, tags, likes, and comments, storing everything in a well-organized DataFrame.<br>
 
 3)Dataset creation: Saved the scraped data as a CSV file named ImageDataset for easy access and analysis.<br>
 
 4)Image download: Loaded the dataset, dynamically assigned names to each image, and downloaded all the images into the imgs folder.<br>
 
 5)Enhanced dataset: After downloading the images, added img_id and img_path to the DataFrame, saving the final dataset as imgdataset.csv.<br>
